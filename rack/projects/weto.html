      <h1>WETO</h1>
      <div class ="project-info_row">
        <p class ="prolog-row">
          WETO is University of Tampere's education tool that is used return course assignments, share course materials and other contents. It is mostly used in SIS &lpar;School of Information Sciences&rpar; because WETO contains autocompiler and autograding systems for programming tasks. 
        </p>
        <p class="prolog-row prolog-row_description">
          WETO project was my first &quot;real&quot; software project. The project's employer was SIS and I was a part of the team which included me, another trainee and two instructors.

        <h3>MY ROLE</h3>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          My responsibilities in this project were mainly UX- and UI-design, usability testing and Front end-development. At the beginning of the project my task was detect usability problems and solve how we can resolve them. So our team started designing how to get rid of those problems and then finally clear out how to implement better solutions for each problem. After the implementation it was time to the testing part where I executed all our usability tests for WETO's end-users. 
        </p>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          Let's discover some examples
        </p>
        <h3>Front page</h3>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          Our client wanted WETO to be more graphical and bring some connections to SIS and UTA. We decided to bring graphical elements with background-image which in this case is one of the UTA's buildings.
        </p>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          We also brought the login-field to the main page because WETO's all functionalities are behind the login, so that is the first and the most common task that user will do. 
        </p>

          <img  src="project-pics/WETO/weto-main-2.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class = "project-plaintext">
        <div class="image-text">First sight of front page</div>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          The Biggest usability problem what our team discovered was the old site's navigation menu. Users did not perceive the left-side element being a navigation menu. Main reasons were that the menu was almost always closed and the <i>collapse</i>-functionality of the list-items wasn't visible for the users.
        </p>

        </div>
        <div class="image-text">Course front page and navigation</div>
        <h3>File submission</h3>
        <p class ="plain-text">
          Other big problem was file submission, where were 3 different phase. What we wanted to do was unite all these phases to one simple view and the best tool for this was ReactJS. With React we were able to do interactive UI-component that show all file submission, autograding and file adding statuses.
